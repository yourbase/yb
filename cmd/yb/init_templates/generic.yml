# YourBase build configuration
# See https://docs.yourbase.io/ for reference.

# We couldn't determine what programming language your project uses,
# so we generated a generic build configuration.

build_targets:
  - name: default
    # Change 'make' to run the command you want.
    # You can also add more commands to be run in the list.
    commands:
      - make

# This section configures which targets get built on CI.
ci:
  builds:
    - name: default
      build_target: default
      # If you only want certain events, uncomment the following line.
      # when: branch IS 'main' OR action IS 'pull_request'
