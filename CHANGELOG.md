[Unreleased]: https://github.com/yourbase/yb/compare/v0.5.4...HEAD

## [Unreleased][]

### Fixed

-  Trying to run a program in a target with `./foo` now works correctly when
   the `--no-container` flag is passed. This was a regression from 0.4.

## [0.5.4][] - 2020-11-30

Version 0.5.4 fixes more regressions from 0.4.

[0.5.4]: https://github.com/yourbase/yb/releases/tag/v0.5.4

### Fixed

-  The Go buildpack now adds `$GOPATH/bin` to `PATH`. This was a regression
   from 0.4.
-  `yb exec --environment=foo` no longer crashes if the `default` environment
   is empty. This was a regression from 0.4.
-  Setting `container.ports` on `exec` or a `build_target` in `.yourbase.yml`
   no longer causes a panic.

## [0.5.3][] - 2020-11-19

Version 0.5.3 fixes minor regressions from 0.4.

[0.5.3]: https://github.com/yourbase/yb/releases/tag/v0.5.3

### Fixed

-  `yb exec` installs the runtime dependencies in its environment. This was a
   regression from 0.4.
-  Container IP addresses in the yb environment are respected in configuration
   environment variable expansions. This was a regression from 0.4.
-  The Ruby buildpack downloads a pinned version of rbenv and ruby-build rather
   than following the latest commit.
-  The Flutter buildpack now correctly handles the same pre-release version
   formats as previous versions of yb.
-  Using yb with the Docker on the Mac will no longer create directories with
   zero permissions.

## [0.5.2][] - 2020-11-18

Version 0.5.2 fixes a major regression in `yb build` behavior.

[0.5.2]: https://github.com/yourbase/yb/releases/tag/v0.5.2

### Fixed

-  Regression: `yb build` would exit with a zero status code on build failures
   in version 0.5. This is now fixed.

## [0.5.1][] - 2020-11-18

Version 0.5.1 was a botched release.

[0.5.1]: https://github.com/yourbase/yb/releases/tag/v0.5.1

## [0.5.0][] - 2020-11-18

Version 0.5 provides better reproducibility and isolation than previous
releases, making it easier to debug your YourBase builds locally.

Notable improvements:

-  `yb run` now runs in the exact same environment as what a build target would
   use, including in a container. You can use `yb run bash` to pull up an
   interactive shell and inspect your environment, `yb run python --version` to
   verify the target's Python version, and more!
-  Non-container builds isolate their environment variables and create a
   per-build-target home directory inside your `~/.cache/yourbase` directory.
   This makes builds far more reproducible and reduces the likelihood that a
   build will interfere with the host system.
-  Build containers get shut down at the end of a build. No more floating
   Docker containers!

[0.5.0]: https://github.com/yourbase/yb/releases/tag/v0.5.0

### Added

-  `yb build`, `yb exec`, and `yb run` now all support two new flags: `--env`
   and `--env-file`. These flags set environment variables in the execution
   environment.
-  A new `--netrc-file` flag for `build`, `exec`, and `run` inject a
   [.netrc file](https://ec.haxx.se/usingcurl/usingcurl-netrc) into the build
   environment. This is combined with any credentials stored in an
   `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/yb/netrc` file.
-  A new `--debug` flag shows debug logs for any command.
-  yb will display a message on startup if the obsolete `$HOME/.yourbase`
   directory exists, encouraging its deletion to save disk space.

### Changed

-  The Docker container for a build is entirely ephemeral: a new container will
   be started for each target and the container will be stopped and removed
   at the end of building the target. The contents of the build's
   `HOME` directory and the package directory will persist between runs, but
   all other changes will be lost, particularly packages installed
   with `apt-get`.
-  `yb build` now directly runs commands in the Docker container instead of
   invoking a copy of itself to run the build.
-  `yb run` now runs commands in the environment of a build target, not an
   exec environment. This also means that `yb run` will operate in an ephemeral
   Docker container by default.
-  To increase isolation in local builds, yb now sets `HOME` to a directory
   cached between builds of the same target instead of using the user's `HOME`
   directory.
-  The `TZ` environment variable is set to the value `UTC` by default for all
   builds to increase reproducibility.
-  yb build commands no longer inherit environment variables for greater
   reproducibility. To set environment variables in your build, use the new
   `--env` or `--env-file` flags. This has the benefit of working regardless
   of whether you're building in a container.
-  `yb remotebuild` will now always use the locally installed Git to determine
   the changed files.

### Removed

-  The `homebrew` buildpack has been removed due to its complexity and
   low usage. Please [file an issue](https://github.com/yourbase/yb/issues/new)
   if your build needs Homebrew specifically.
-  `yb remotebuild` no longer has the `--print-status` or `--go-git-status` flags.

### Fixed

-  `yb build` now builds dependency targets (specified with `build_after`)
   with the same environment as if they were built directly. In particular,
   container dependencies will be started for each target, whereas previous
   versions would only start the container dependencies for the target named
   on the command line.

### Security

-  The Ant buildpack now downloads over HTTPS from the sonic.net mirror. It was
   previously using the lucidnetworks.net mirror over HTTP.

## [0.4.4][] - 2020-11-05

Version 0.4.4 fixes an issue with containers in environments that don't have
a `docker0` network like WSL and macOS.

[0.4.4]: https://github.com/yourbase/yb/releases/tag/v0.4.4

### Fixed

-  Port wait checks will now automatically forward a port on any host that does
   not have a `docker0` network. Previously, this behavior was only used on
   macOS, but it is also applicable to Docker Desktop with WSL.

## [0.4.3][] - 2020-11-05

Version 0.4.3 was a botched release from an unstable development commit.

[0.4.3]: https://github.com/yourbase/yb/releases/tag/v0.4.3

## [0.4.2][] - 2020-10-20

Version 0.4.2 fixes an issue with `yb remotebuild`.

[0.4.2]: https://github.com/yourbase/yb/releases/tag/v0.4.2

### Fixed

-  `yb remotebuild` no longer panics

## [0.4.1][] - 2020-10-13

Version 0.4.1 fixes a regression introduced by 0.4.0.

[0.4.1]: https://github.com/yourbase/yb/releases/tag/v0.4.1

### Changed

-  Attempting to use an unknown container in `{{.Container.IP}}` substitutions
   will now cause a build failure rather than silently expanding to the
   empty string.

### Fixed

-  Fixed the `{{.Container.IP}}` regression introduced in v0.4.0.

## [0.4.0][] - 2020-10-12

Version 0.4 removes some broken or ill-conceived functionality from yb and
changes where yb stores files to obey the [XDG Base Directory specification][].

[0.4.0]: https://github.com/yourbase/yb/releases/tag/v0.4.0
[XDG Base Directory specification]: https://specifications.freedesktop.org/basedir-spec/basedir-spec-latest.html

### Changed

-  The build cache is now created under `$XDG_CACHE_HOME/yb`
   (usually `$HOME/.cache/yb`) rather than `$HOME/.yourbase`.
   You can safely remove `$HOME/.yourbase` to reclaim disk space.

### Removed

-  Workspaces. At the moment, we're focusing on single packages and will
   reintroduce the concept when we have a better grasp on how dependencies will
   work inside yb.
-  The build log streaming feature has been removed, since it has been broken
   for some time. However, we hope to reintroduce it in a future version.
-  Removed the `yb update` command. Users can now stay up-to-date with either
   the APT or Homebrew repositories.

### Fixed

-  yb now respects the `XDG_CONFIG_HOME` and `XDG_CONFIG_DIRS` environment
   variables when reading configuration files.
-  Update to latest version of [Narwhal](https://github.com/yourbase/narwhal),
   which contains many fixes for Docker interactions.
-  `yb build` will now exit with a non-zero status code if more than one
   argument is given. Previously, it would silently ignore such arguments.
-  The download span names in the `yb build` trace now include the URL rather
   than the unhelpful `%s`.

## [0.3.2][] - 2020-10-07

Version 0.3.2 fixes issues with the Python buildpack.

[0.3.2]: https://github.com/yourbase/yb/releases/tag/v0.3.2

### Fixed

-  Fixed an incorrect URL for Miniconda in the Python buildpack.
-  HTTP downloads in yb no longer ignore the status code and will abort for
   any non-200 status code.

## [0.3.1][] - 2020-10-06

Version 0.3.1 fixes an issue with error handling during builds.

[0.3.1]: https://github.com/yourbase/yb/releases/tag/v0.3.1

### Fixed

-  Fixed a regression where if a dependent target fails, it did not stop
   the build.

## [0.3.0][] - 2020-10-05

Version 0.3 is the first release with our new release automation.

[0.3.0]: https://github.com/yourbase/yb/releases/tag/v0.3.0

### Added

-  Add `yb token` command

### Changed

-  We are no longer using Equinox for releases. See the
   [README](https://github.com/yourbase/yb/blob/main/README.md) for installation
   instructions.
-  Release binaries are now smaller due to debug symbol stripping.
-  Release binaries are now built as [position-independent executables][].
-  The output of timing information at the end of a build has changed formatting
   slightly to accommodate more sophisticated breakdowns in the future.

[position-independent executables]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Position-independent_code

### Fixed

-  Fixes to OpenJDK and Anaconda buildpacks
   ([#170](https://github.com/yourbase/yb/pull/170))
