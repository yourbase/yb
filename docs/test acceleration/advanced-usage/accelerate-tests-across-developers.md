# Accelerate tests locally across developers
Developers who are working on the same branch can gain acceleration from the dependency graphs created on their peers' local machines by accessing a [shared dependency graph](../how-it-works.md#shared-dependency-graph).   

You can set it up using the same steps that are used to [accelerate tests in your CI environment](accelerate-tests-in-ci.md).
